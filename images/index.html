                <h4 class="topic-card-text">OUTLINE: People who are afraid of the dark might need the nightlight to be able to sleep in comfort of a warm white LED light without the fear of the darkness consuming them in the night time while they are asleep. And for the design, this is based off the Egg Spaceship in the show of “Inanimate Insanity”, so for people who are fans of the animated show, or might like spaceships in general, might be interested in using this nightlight!</h4>

                <alt="REQUIREMENTS:">
                <h4 class="topic-card-text">REQUIREMENTS: Must light up on command using a switch, no flickering lights, must be able to stand up (we will make a nest for it to be able to stand up), everything must work smoothly, measurements are: 10 cm in height, 11 cm in width, and 10 cm in length, and for the circuit, the colour of the LED light must be white, or a warm colour of some kind.</h4>

                <alt="SPECIFICATIONS:">
                <h4 class="topic-card-text">SPECIFICATIONS: The nightlight will be in the shape of an egg, with a black casing that will have white translucent paper that will support the case. It will also be able to stand up properly with a nest that we will make out of sticks and cotton, and to add in with the futuristic look we will add some electronic components into the nest that will surround the Egg Spaceship Nightlight like how there would be worms surrounding the egg before the egg hatches into a baby bird, so the baby bird feeds on the worms. With that as well, we will need a battery pack that can be able to change the batteries, since the nightlight will work on batteries, and a functioning circuit, blending in both Digital Technologies and Electronics smoothly.</h4>
