Hey! This is a website for my Student Lead project in Digital Technologies and Electronics! For my project, I'm working with someone else. And together, we're making an Egg Spaceship Nightlight! This website contains the information about the Egg Spaceship Nightlight; how we made it, why we made it, who it is for, the drafts, how it ended up looking like... Yeah! That sort of thing! Now, at the moment (September 18, 2025) there isn't much, because i have actually started making the website today, but over the course of time, it will look better, and we will have more information about the Egg Spaceship Nightlight, and eventually, we will finish the project! I am looking forward to that!
